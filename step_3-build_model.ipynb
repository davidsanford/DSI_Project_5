I will consider not only the Logistic Regression method used in the previous step, but also k-nearest neighbors and SVC classifiers.  Given the highly non-linear behavior of the Madelon data set, these classifiers may provide better accuracy than the linear logistic regression classifier.  I hope to significantly improve upon the low accuracies found in the previous sections. "

The SelectKBest transformation is applied in a loop, each time creating a copy of the original data frame to train upon.  Then, each model is applied in a GridSearchCV object, with a range of chosen parameters.  The accuracies of the best models upon the training set are displayed below, and the best was selected to be re-fit and have its performance tested on the validation set."

In contrast, a k-Nearest Neighbors model selected using a grid search using only a sub-set of the data improved upon this significantly, generating a 79.5% accuracy on the validation set.\n",
