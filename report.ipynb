    "Of the three models used, logistic regression has the worst performance.  While reducing the number of features improved the fit somewhat, further use of Ridge regularization resulted in no further improvement in accuracy.  This is unsurprising, as the Madelon data set is highly non-linear and logistic regression is a linear model.  Both k-nearest neighbors and SVC had similar performance to logistic regression on the 2-feature model, which suggests that not enough information is contained in those two features for an accurate prediction.  For 8 and 30 features, in comparison, both k-nearest neighbors and SVC had superior performance to linear regression.  In both cases the performance was best for 8 features, with accuracies of 82% and 75% for k-nearest neighbors and SVC respectively."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I considered classification algorithms on the Madelon data set.  I set up a modular pipeline used for benchmarking, feature selection, and model selection.  From a benchmark accuracy of 53% on a data set with baseline accuracy of 50%, I identified a model using k-nearest neighbors classification which has an 82% accuracy on the cross-validated training set and 79% accuracy on the validation set.  I also discussed the relative performance for logistic regression, SVC, and k-nearest neighbors classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways this process might be improved to find a more accurate model, most of which are beyond the computationa power I have available.  There is a significant change in accuracy for the three values of number of features used, so a more granular scan could find a better number of features.  Similarly, expanding the list of internal model parameters to search over and improving the granularity of the scan.  More classifiers could also be considered, such as decision trees or perceptrons.  For logistic regression, polynomial features might improve the fits, though that depends greatly on how the non-linearity in the synthetic data set was generated."
