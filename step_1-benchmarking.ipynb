    "Here I am working with the Madelon data set, a synthetic data set with many variables and a high degree of non-linearity.  My goal is to generate an effective benchmark for the performance of logistic regression on the data set using multiple metrics.  Given the size of the data set, addition of additional features is computationally impractical, so I restrict my attention to the baseline data set."

    "\n",
    "I wish to separate the entire data set into two set sets, with approximately a 70%/30% split with randomized indices.  The larger data set will be used as a training set for training and cross-validating potential models and the latter of will be set aside as an ultimate validation set.  The validation set will not be touched till the end of step 3.  I also wish to normalize the columns in the training set and perform an identical shift and rescaling on the validation set.  Then I will produce summary metrics for a naive logistic regression and determine the best metric to use for further refining the model."

Since the baseline accuracy is nearly 50%, this means that the test training set has a nearly equal number of positive and negative labels.  As such, all the significance metrics would be expected to increase with one another (in contrast to scenarios where one label significantly outnumbers another, where accuracy can increase but precision and/or recall can be nearly zero as the model approaches the situation of uniformly predicting one class).  Moreover, since the data set is synthetic, there is no obvious metric which is inherently desireable for field-specific reason.  In this scenario, accuracy is the easiest metric to extract meaning from, so I will use it throughout."

The simplistic model predictivity gives a sense of how much feature/model selection may be necessary to improve the result.\n",
